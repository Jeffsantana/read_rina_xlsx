#How to Install
Using Git (recommended)
Clone the project from github. Change "myproject" to your project name.

Install npm dependencies after installing
cd ~/myproject
$ yarn

#Setting up environments (development or production)
In the root this repository you will find a file named .env.example
Create a new file by copying and pasting the file and then renaming it to just .env
The file .env is already ignored, so you never commit your credentials.
Change the values of the file to your environment (development or production)
Upload the .env to your environment server(development or production)

#How to run development mode
cd ~/myproject
yarn dev
You will know server is running by checking the output of the command yarn dev:

---

$ yarn dev
yarn run v1.22.11
$ ts-node-dev --respawn --transpile-only --ignore-watch node_modules server.ts
[INFO] 10:28:19 ts-node-dev ver. 1.1.8 (using ts-node ver. 9.1.1, typescript ver. 4.4.2)
ðŸš€ Server Running
ðŸš€ Port 4500
ðŸš€ Mongodb connected

see the status information in: http://localhost:4500/api/v1

#How to run production mode
use pm2 (Advanced, production process manager for Node.js) [http://pm2.keymetrics.io/]
bash
npm run production

#Usage
Need new modules? The module contains everything with direct relation. Like a models, controllers, use cases, routes. Create a new path with name of new module, and four paths inside: controllers, models, routes and useCases. 

We use class, is good! 

Creating new controllers
If you need to add more controllers to the project just create a new file with class and export in /src/app/modules/new_module/controllers/NewController.ts 

Creating new models
If you need to add more models to the project just create a new file with class and export in /src/app/modules/new_module/models/NewModel.ts

Creating new routes
If you need to add more routes to the project just create a new file with class and export in /src/app/modules/new_module/routes/index.ts and load+export this file in /src/app/routes/index.js
